### **Proactive interference**
when info learned previously interferes with learning new information

### **Retroactive interference**
when more recent learning interferes with memory for something that happened in the past

### 2 reason we forget
**Trace-dependent forgetting** : information is no longer stored in memory 
**Cue-dependent forgetting** : information is in memory(stored), but cannot be accessed(cannot be retrieved).

#### **Tulving and Psotka (1971)**

**Stimulus:** 
1-6 word lists ; each has 4 words ; for 6 categories
**Procedure:** 
- `Original learning` : list presented, free recall as many words 
- `Total free recall` : list presented, recall all lists 
- `Total cued recall` : category names presented, recall all word, all list
**Outcome:**
- `Total free recall` : evidence of retroactive interference (recent learning interferes with past info) ; unlearning of earlier list, cue dependent forgetting 
- `Total cued recall` : no retroactive interference/forgetting when category presented
