**Stimulus:**
- Nonsense syllables to avoid influence by meaning
**Outcome:**
- forgetting occurs rapidly within the first hour after learning, but the rate of forgetting significantly decreases over time.
**Ways to overcome:**
- `Savings method:` read out loud over and over and determined how many repetitions it took to repeat the lists with no errors
- Recalled the nonsense syllables at various intervals, re-learned the list until syllables were remembered

**Forgetting Curve**

- short intervals between initial learning and relearning 
- it usually took fewer repetitions to relearn the list than it had taken him to initially learn it
