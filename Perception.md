### Perception 
the process where information is received through sense organs, leading to experiences such as the recognition of objects, sounds, tastes, and smells.

### Perceptual segregation
ability to determine which part of presented visual info belongs together and separate the objects

### Gestalt Theory 
pattern recognition based on the perception of the whole pattern of stimuli

1. **Good figure/ simplicity**
	Every stimulus pattern is seen in such a way that the resulting structure is as simple as possible
2. **Similarity**
	Similar things appear to be grouped together
3. **Good continuation**
	Points that, when connected, result in straight or smoothly curving lines, are seen as belonging together, and the lines tend to be seen as following the smoothest path.
4. **Proximity** 
	Things that are near to each other appear to be grouped together
5. **Common fate**
	Things that are moving in the same direction appear to be grouped together
6. **Familiarity**
	Things are more likely to appear as groups if the groups appear familiar and meaningful
7. **Closure**
	Things are likely to be seen as complete figures even when part of the information is missing

### Top down processing
occurs when previous experience and expectations are first used to recognize stimuli

#### Palmer (1975) Contextual scene experiment
**Stimulus :** 
- Showed context scene such as a kitchen scene on the left. 
- Showed an object on the right side. Examples of the objects were a loaf of bread, a mailbox and a drum. 
**Procedure :** 
- Participants were asked to identify the correct objects for the context scene shown on the left side. 
- Briefly flashed the objects of the right one at a time. 
**Outcome :** 
- When asked participants to identify the objects in the target picture (kitchen scene), they correctly identified an object like loaf of bread 80% of the time better than objects that donâ€™t fit the scene (only 40% of the time)

### Bottom-up processing
occurs when we sense basic features of stimuli and integrate them
