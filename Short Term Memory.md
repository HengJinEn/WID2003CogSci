**Memory:**
Processes involved in retaining, retrieving and using information about stimuli, images, events, ideas and skills after original information is no longer present

Modal Model of Memory:
**Structural features**: 
Sensory store is an initial stage that holds all incoming information for seconds or fractions of a second. 
**Short-term memory (STM)**: 
holds 5–7 items for about 15– 30 seconds 
**Long-term memory (LTM)**: 
can hold a large amount of information for years or even decades
**Control process:**
- Rehearsal : repeat stimulus over and over
- Strategies to make stimulus more memorable

Sperling’s experiment

**Chunking:**
process of separating large task into sets of smaller tasks

**Chunk:**
group of related information that shares related characteristics which normally appear in sets of small groups called units

Chase and Simon (1973a, 1973b)

#### How is information coded in STM
**Coding** : way info is represented
**Auditory** : Sound of the person’s voice 
**Visual** : Image of the person 
**Semantic** : Meaning of what the person is saying
