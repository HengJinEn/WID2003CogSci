limited-capacity system for temporary storage and manipulation of information for complex tasks such as comprehension, learning, and reasoning

**Phonological loop:**
- holds verbal(spoken words) and auditory information

**Visuospatial sketch pad:**
- holds visual and spatial (occupying space) information

**Central executive:**
- pulls information from long-term memory
- coordinates the activity of the phonological loop and visuospatial sketch pad by focusing on specific parts of a task and switching attention from one part to another
- decide how to divide attention between different task

### Tasks Supporting the Phonological Loop

1. **Phonological Similarity Effect**
   - **Task 1**: Read and write the letters g, c, b, t, v, p.
   - **Task 2**: Read and write the letters f, l, k, s, m, g.
   - **Outcome**: Task 1 is more difficult due to `confusion from similar-sounding letters`.
   - **Conclusion**: It is easier to remember different-sounding letters (Task 2).

2. **Word Length Effect**
   - **Task 1**: Read and write the words: beast, bronze, wife, golf, inn, limp, dirt, star.
   - **Task 2**: Read and write the words: alcohol, property, amplifier, officer, gallery, mosquito, orchestra, bricklayer.
   - **Outcome**: Task 2 is more difficult due to `longer words`.
   - **Conclusion**: Memory for lists of words is better for short words than for long words.

3. **Articulatory Suppression**
   - **Task 1**: Read and write the words: dishwasher, hummingbird, engineering, hospital, homelessness, reasoning.
   - **Task 2**: Read the words while repeating “the” out loud, then look away and write: automobile, apartment, basketball, mathematics, syllogism, idealism.
   - **Outcome**: Task 2 is more difficult due to the `inability to rehearse the words`.
   - **Conclusion**: Articulatory suppression reduces the ability to remember lists of words, demonstrating both the word-length effect (no rehearsal) and the phonological similarity effect.

### Task Supporting Visuospatial Sketchpad

   - **Task 1**: Memorize the sentence "John ran to the store to buy some oranges." Without looking, consider each word in order and say “yes” if it is a noun and “no” if it isn’t.
   - **Task 2**: Memorize the same sentence. Using a figure with Y and N, point to Y if the word is a noun and N if it isn’t, moving down a row for each new word.
   - **Outcome:** Task 2 was easier than Task 1.
   - **Reasoning**:
     - Task 1: Both the stimulus and task were verbal, leading to phonological loop overload and increased difficulty.
     - Task 2: The stimulus was verbal, but the task involved spatial processing, distributing the workload between the phonological loop and the visuospatial sketchpad, making it easier.


### Task that support Central executive
#### Gazzaley (2005) Experiment Conclusion
 **Task**: 
-  Participants were instructed to remember faces and ignore scenes (active task) or to passively view the stimuli without specific focus (passive task).
**Stimuli Presentation**: 
- The task involved presenting a sequence of images (faces and scenes) followed by a delay and then testing memory for the faces using fMRI to measure brain activity.
**Outcome**: 
- Participants who effectively suppressed irrelevant information (scenes) showed better memory for relevant information (faces), highlighting the role of the central executive in managing attention and memory.
- Good suppressors had a higher percentage of correct face identification compared to poor suppressors.
