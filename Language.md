a system of communication using sounds or symbols that enables us to express our feelings, thoughts, ideas, and experiences

##### What differs human and non-human(animal) language? 
1. Hierarchical 
2. Rules 

**Lexicon:**
all words a person understand

**Phoneme:**
smallest unit of language that refers to sounds

**Morpheme:**
smallest unit of language that refers to meaning

**Phonemic Restoration Effect (Warren, 1970):**

- **Aim:** Studied how meaning affects the perception of phonemes by replacing sounds in sentences.
- **Procedure:** Participants heard sentences like "The state governors met with their respective legislatures convening in the capital city," where the initial /s/ in "legislatures" was replaced with a cough sound.
- **Outcome:** Despite the missing phoneme (/s/), participants did not detect its absence and could not accurately identify where the cough occurred. This effect persisted even when participants were aware of the missing sound.
- **Influence of Meaning:** The effect was influenced by the meaning of words following the missing phoneme. For example, in the context "There was time to *ave," participants interpreted the missing sound differently depending on the subsequent word ("save," "shave," etc.), showing how meaning guides perception.

**Speech segmentation:**
- process of perceiving individual words from the continuous flow of the speech signal
- Easy to recognize words on this screen as they’re separated by spaces. 
- Speech signal is continuous. Difficult to tell from sound where one word ends and the other begins.

**Problem of segmentation**
- People talk different accents/speeds
- When words are taken out of the context provided by other words in a conversation, understanding the words becomes much more difficult (Importance of context )

**Words superiority effect**
letters are easier to recognize when contained in a word, compared to when appeared alone or are contained in a nonword


**How do we understand words? – 3 ways** 
1. **Word frequency**
	Respond more rapidly to high frequency words than to low frequency word
2. **Context effect**
	Words expected in the context (e.g. Eskimos-walrus) were understood rapidly than those not in context (e.g. bankers-walrus)
3. **Lexical ambiguity**
	When ambiguous words appear in a sentence, we usually use the context of the sentence to determine which definition applies

**Priming**
seeing a stimulus makes it easier to respond to that stimulus when it is presented again, activates the representation of the stimulus

**Lexical priming** 
priming involving the naming of word

**How do words work together to create the meaning of the sentence?**
**Semantics** : meaning of words and sentences 
**Syntax** : grammar / rule for combining words into sentences

**Parsing:**
processes for determining meaning ; the mental grouping of words in a sentence into phrases

**Syntactic ambiguity** 
words same, but more than one structure / meaning

**Parser** 
mechanism to determine meaning by grouping words into appropriate phrases

**Syntax first approach of parsing (Garden path model)**
Parsing is first determined by the grammatical structure of the sentence

**Late closure** : when a person encounters a new word, the parser assumes that this word is part of the current phrase

**Garden-path sentence** 
Grammatically correct sentence that led the reader down the path that seems right, but turns out to be wrong ; the reader is trapped into a parse that turns out to be a dead end.

**Interactionist approach to parsing**
All information (both syntactic and semantic) is considered as we read sentences.

**Anaphoric** : inferences that connect an object or person in one sentence to an object or person in another sentence

**Instrumental** : inference about tools/instrument

**Causal** : conclusion that events in one clause/sentence caused by events in a previous sentence
