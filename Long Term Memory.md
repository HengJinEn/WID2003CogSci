Acts as an "archive" of past events and learned knowledge

**Primacy effect:**
had time to rehearse & transfer to LTM

**Recency effect:**
words are still in STM

**Serial Position Curve:**
rehearsal of the early words might lead to better memory by presenting the list at a slower pace, so there was more time between each word and participants had more time to rehearse

**Declarative memory:**
conscious recollection of events we have experienced or facts we have learned

- **Episodic memory:**
	personal experience events / memory of specific events including when and where they occurred

- **Semantic:**
	facts and knowledge about the world including numbers, concepts, and vocabulary, not skills / memory of general knowledge not associated with a particular context

**Implicit memory:**
occurs when a past experience influences behavior, but unaware that the experience influences behavior

- **Repetition priming:**
	when the response to an item increases in speed or accuracy because it has been encountered recently
	
- **Procedural memory**
	memory that is expressed through performance rather than recollection / memory for actions, skills and operations


### How does information becomes stored in LTM?
**Encoding** : process of acquiring information and transforming it into LTM 
**Retrieval** : process of transferring information from LTM back into WM, where it becomes accessible to consciousness 
**Maintenance rehearsal** : helps `maintain information` in memory, but not effective for transferring information into LTM 
**Elaborative rehearsal** : `associate meaning` of an item or make connections between the item, effective for encoding info into LTM

### Level of processing
**Shallow processing** :
- involves little attention to meaning 
- E.g. task 1 ; maintenance rehearsal 
**Deep processing** : 
- involves close attention to meaning and relates it to something else
- E.g. Task 2 ; elaborative rehearsal ; better memory

**Shallow** – word’s physical characteristics 
**Deeper** – word’s sound 
**Deepest** – word’s meaning

### Morrison et al (1977) Experiment 

**Transfer-Appropriate Processing**: 
- Memory performance is better when the type of task at encoding matches the type of task at retrieval. 
- Participants were shown 32 target words and later tested with a recognition task.

**Task Types and Outcomes**:
   - **Meaning Task**: Involves deeper processing by focusing on the meaning of words, which typically results in better recall (consistent with Levels of Processing theory).
   - **Rhyming Task**: Focuses on the sound of words, leading to better recall when the retrieval task also involves rhyming, showing that the type of processing at encoding (sound focus) can enhance memory if it matches the retrieval task.

**Conclusion**: 
- memory performance is influenced by both the level of processing and how well the conditions at encoding match the conditions at retrieval
- "shallower" sound-based processing can be effective if retrieval conditions align.

### Factors that Aid Encoding

1. **Forming Connections with Other Information**
   - **Complex Sentences (Craik & Tulving, 1975)**:
     - Memory improves when information is presented within a complex sentence.
     - Creates more connections between the words and other information, aiding retrieval.
   - **Imagery (Bower & Winzenz, 1970)**:
     - Participants who formed mental images remembered more than twice as much as those who repeated word pairs.
   - **Self-Reference Effect (Rogers et al., 1979)**:
     - Memory is better when relating a word to oneself.
     - Deeper processing occurs when linking information to personal cues.

2. **Generating Information**
   - **Generation Effect (Slameka and Graf, 1978)**:
     - Participants who generated their own material (e.g., filling in blanks) had better memory retention than those who passively read the material.
     - Outcome: Generate group recalled 28% more than the read group.

3. **Organizing Information**
   - **Categorization (Gordon and Bower et al., 1969)**:
     - Organizing items into categories or a structured tree enhances recall.
     - Outcome: Participants recalled 73 words with organized tree structure vs. 21 words with random words.
   - **Framework (Bransford & Johnson, 1972)**:
     - Understanding and memory are improved when provided with an organizational framework (e.g., seeing a picture before reading a passage).
     - Outcome: Participants who saw the picture before reading remembered twice as much.

#### How do we retrieve info from LTM?
**Retrieval  clues**
info that help us remember other information stored in memory

**Recall procedures:**
**Free recall** – asked to recall stimuli in any order
**Cued recall** – presented wt cues(word/phrase) to aid recall

**Encoding specificity** 
Information is learned together with its context

**Godden & Baddeley (1975)** : diving experiment 
- G1 : Put on diving equipments, studied list of words whilst underwater 
- G2 : study words on land 
- Recall : G1 (underwater) , G2 (on land) 
- Outcome : best recall occurred when encoding and retrieval occurred in the same condition
