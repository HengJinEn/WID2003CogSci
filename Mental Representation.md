**Schema:**
structured cluster of concepts that involves generic knowledge about the world, situation, relations and objects

**Brewer & Treyens, 1981** 
**Aim** : 
how memory is influenced by people’s schemas about offices 
**Method** : 
- Participants were seated in an office waiting to be in an experiment 
- Called into another room 
**Task** : 
- write down what they saw while they were sitting in the office
**Outcome** : 
- wrote down many things they remembered seeing, but also included some things that were not there but which fit into their “office schema.” 
- E.g. : no books, 30% reported they saw book

**Bartlett (1932)**
**Aim** : test how ppl’s understanding and remembrance of events was shaped by their expectations 
**Method** : 
- gave English subjects a North American Indian folk tale to memorise and recall later at different time intervals. 
- The folk tale had many strange attributions and a causal structure that was contrary to Western expectations. 
**Outcome** : participants “reconstructed” the story rather than remembering it verbatim, reflected to participant’s own culture

**Script**
conception of the sequence of actions that usually occur during a particular experience
- **False memory**

**Visual Imagery**
- ‘seeing’ in the absence of a visual stimulus.
- Ability to recreate the sensory world in the absence of physical stimuli

**Mental imagery**: 
experiencing a sensory impression in the absence of sensory input

**Alan Paivio (1963)**
**Method** : Paired-associate learning 
- Participants were presented with pairs of words (e.g.: boat-hat, car-house) during study period 
- Presented with first word from each pair during test period 
- Task : Recall the paired word 
**Outcome** : easier to remember concrete nouns (e.g. truck, tree) that can be imagined, than abstract nouns (e.g.: truth, justice) that are difficult to imagine 
**Propose** : conceptual-peg hypothesis

**Shepard and Metzler**
**Mental Rotation:** 
- mentally imagining how an object would appear if rotated in space.

**Experimental Design:** Participants were presented with pairs of three-dimensional objects that varied in their rotation angles.

**Task:** Participants had to quickly determine whether each pair of objects depicted the same object or two different objects.

**Results:** 
  - Reaction times were directly proportional to the angle of rotation between the objects.
  - The greater the angle of rotation from the original position, the longer it took participants to decide if the objects were the same or different.
  - This linear relationship suggests that mental rotation involves a systematic process where the degree of rotation directly affects cognitive processing time.

**Kosslyn’s mental scanning exp : (Supported)** 
**Method** : participants memorize a picture of an object (e.g. : boat), create mental image of the picture, focus on one part of the picture (e.g: anchor) 
**Task** : asked to look for another part of the boat (e.g. : motor), press ‘true’ when found the part, ‘no’ if not found 
**Hypothesis** : if imagery (like perception) is spatial, it takes longer time to find parts located farther from initial point of focus due to scanning across image of the object 
**Outcome** : supported hypothesis above

### Use imagery to improve memory
- visualizing interacting images
- placing images at locations
	- method of loci: things to be remembered are placed at different locations in a mental image of a spatial layout
- associating images with words
	- use pegword technique
