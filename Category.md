process by which things are placed into groups

### Why categories are useful?
- Understand individual cases never seen before
- Serve as a valuable tool for making inferences about things that belong to other categories
- Help to understand behaviors we might find strange

**Family resemblance (Wittgenstein, 1953)**
- definitions often do not include all members of a category
- members within a category can exhibit similarities in various ways, without each necessarily meeting a strict set of criteria

**Prototype:**
- averaging the category members we have encountered in the past

**High prototypicality** : the category member `closely resembles` the category prototype (it is like a “typical” member of the category) 
**Low prototypicality** : category member `does not resemble` a typical member of the category

**Rosch and Mervis's (1975)**
**Hypothesis:**
Prototypical objects within a category, such as chairs and sofas, exhibit high family resemblance, sharing many common characteristics like being furniture with seats and backs.

**Result:**
Participants readily list shared characteristics for prototypical objects like chairs and sofas but struggle to find commonalities between objects with lower prototypicality, such as mirrors and telephones, which belong to different functional categories within furniture.

**Examplar:**
Use real examples(or individual cases) to counter for a typical cases (such as flightless birds) rather than comparing an object with an average/standard object

**Hierarchy of Categories:** Categories can be organized hierarchically into three levels:

- **Superordinate:** Larger, more general categories 
- **Basic:** Intermediate level categories that are psychologically privileged and commonly used 
- **Subordinate:** Smaller, more specific categories within the basic level 

**Rosch and Mervis (1976) Findings:**
- Basic level categories are psychologically privileged because they provide a balance of information richness without excessive loss or gain. 
- They are frequently chosen and used in everyday communication due to their practicality and informativeness.
- Participants tend to prefer and select basic-level names (e.g., Guitar, Fish, Pants) over superordinate or subordinate names in categorization tasks.

**Semantic network approach:**
concepts are arranged in networks representing the way concepts are organized in the mind

**Cognitive Economy:**
- In semantic networks, cognitive economy refers to storing shared properties (such as "can fly" for birds) at higher-level nodes (like "bird") rather than duplicating them for every subtype (like "canary").
- This approach minimizes storage space and cognitive load by reducing redundancy and organizing information efficiently.

**Advantages of the Collins & Quillian Model:**
- **Efficiency in Information Retrieval:** By storing common properties at higher-level nodes, the model predicts that retrieval time is determined by the distance traveled through the network.
- **Testable Predictions:** The model's prediction that retrieval time correlates with the hierarchical distance (e.g., quicker verification for "a canary is a bird" than "a canary is an animal") is supported by empirical data using sentence verification tasks.
- **Experimental Validation:** Empirical studies confirm that statements requiring longer traversal through the semantic network (e.g., from "canary" to "animal" compared to "bird") result in longer reaction times, validating the model's predictions about cognitive processing efficiency.

**Category size effect** 
Larger categories require more time for search than do smaller categories
