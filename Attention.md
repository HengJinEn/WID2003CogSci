**Attention**
process of concentrating on specific features of the environment, or on certain thoughts or activities which leads to the exclusion of other features

**Bottleneck theory**
suggests that individuals have a limited amount of attentional resources that they can use at one time

**Consciousness**
Awareness of the selected event. It's limited, meaning we can only be aware of a few things at any one time.

**Relationship between attention and consciousness**
- conscious processing capacity is quite limited
- attention screens information before it reaches awareness
- information that is attended is conscious

**Selective Attention**
Ability to attend to one message and ignore others

**Dichotic listening**
Participants hear two different messages in each ear and are asked to focus on one. This shows selective attention by repeating (shadowing) the attended message.

**Early selection** : 
Switch Model / Broadbent’s Filter Model 
Split - scan experiment
Cocktail party effect

**Intermediate selection** : 
Treisman’s Attenuation Model 

**Late selection** : 
Deutsch-Norman Memory Selection Model
MacKay (1973)

**Comparison between models of attention (early and late selection models)** 
**Early selection** (Broadbent’s approach) is based on `physical characteristics`. 
**Late selection** (MacKay’s approach) is based on `meaning`. 
Treisman’s attenuation model falls in-between these two because selection can be based on physical characteristics, meaning, or both

**Capacity theory:**
limited amount of mental effort to distribute across tasks, so there are limitations on the number of tasks we can perform at the same time

**Mental effort:**
amount of mental capacity required to perform a task

**High load task:**
uses most or all of a person’s resources and so leaves no capacity to handle other tasks
**Low load task:**
uses few resources, leaving some to handle other tasks
Flanker compatibility test

**Divided attention:**
Ability to focus on a few things at once ; distribution of attention to two or more tasks
- **Automatic processing**:
	- Does not require conscious control
	- Schneider and Shiffrin (1977)
	- Posner and Snyder (1975) – 3 criteria to determine a skill is automatic:
		- Occurs without intention 
		- Does not give rise to conscious awareness 
		- Does not interfere with other mental activities4
	- Stroop effect: 
		- difficult to say out the ink colour, than to read the word 
		- caused by people’s inability to avoid paying attention to the meanings of the words, even though they are instructed to ignore them  
		- reading is highly practiced and has become so automatic that it is difficult not to read them
- **Controlled processing:**
	- Requires conscious control 
	- Need to pay close attention at all times and had to search for the target among the distractors in a much slower and more controlled way than in the consistent mapping condition.
