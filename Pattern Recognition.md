Translating patterns of sensory signals into psychological experiences of recognizable objects.

**Case 1:**
> You and your friend are standing by the sea, and you see an object in the distance. You point out the object to your friend and remark on the danger of a swimmer being that far from shore. Your friend laugh and says that the object is not a person but is a turtle. You look again and still see a person.

**Conclusion:** 
- Respond differently to exactly the same pattern of physical energy. 
- The complexity of pattern recognition can be illustrated by considering some very common situations.

**Case 2:**
> Given to you is an article with various styles of handwriting.

**Conclusion:** 
- Different patterns of physical energy are frequently recognized as the same pattern. 
- Each letter of the alphabet is one kind of pattern. 
- In spite of the variability presented by physical information, the psychological mechanisms respond consistently and accurately

### How do recognize pattern?
- Our LTM contains descriptions of many kinds of patterns. 
- When we see/hear a pattern, we form a description of it and compare the description against the descriptions stored in our LTM. 
- We are able to recognize the pattern if its description closely matches one of the descriptions stored in LTM.

### Theories of pattern recognition
#### Template Theory
Mechanisms:
- Image generated from external stimulus is matched to an internal mental representation of the stimulus.
- Template is then computed to determine the overlapping of two stimulus.
- High degree of overlap produce recognition of the object

### Feature Theory
Mechanisms:
- An image is decomposed into components, or features, which uniquely identify different objects through various combinations. 
- Marâ€™s model incorporates motivation, ability, role perceptions, and situational factors to recognize features, such as distinguishing a dent on a car or familiar faces. 
- This theory is efficient for symbolic systems like letters and numbers, but its limitation lies in the small, finite set of symbols.

### Feature Integration Theory
Mechanisms:
- Emphasizes the role of attention in pattern recognition, involving two stages to identify and combine features of an object. 
- In the pre-attentive stage, features such as color, motion, orientation, and curvature are automatically identified without the need for attention. 
- These features are then combined in the focused attention stage to recognize the object.

#### Treisman & Gelade, 1980
identify a target item located in a visual field that was filled with nontarget items, or distractors

**Stimulus:**
Display of multiple letter

**Procedure:**
- Display visual fields with varying numbers of 'S' distractors and one dark 'T' target per trial.
- Instruct participants to locate and respond to the dark 'T' as quickly as possible.

**Outcome:**
- **Preattentive Search**: Reaction time remains constant with fewer distractors, indicating easy target detection.
- **Attentive Search**: Reaction time increases linearly with more distractors, indicating difficult target detection.
- **Search Efficiency**: Visual search efficiency depends on the distinctiveness of the target and the number of distractors.

### Structural Theory
- Structural Theory addresses the limitations of Feature Theory by emphasizing the importance of `spatial relationships` among parts.
- Unlike Feature Theory, it proposes that objects are perceived based on three-dimensional geometric components called `geons`.
- These geons are stored in long-term memory and can be identified from various angles, enabling object recognition even with partial information. 
- Thus, if enough information about an object's basic geons is available, the object can be accurately identified.
