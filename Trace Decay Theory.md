- forgetting that occurs as a result of the automatic decay or fading of the memory trace
- focuses on time and the limited duration of short term memory
- suggests short term memory can only hold information for between 15 and 30 seconds 
### Jenkins and Dallenbach (1924)

**Procedure:** 
- Two students were tested on their memory retention after being either awake or asleep during the retention interval.
**Hypothesis:** 
- forgetting would be the same regardless of being awake or asleep.
**Outcome:** 
- showed less forgetting after sleep. 
- interference with memory is greater when awake.

### Hockey, Davies, and Gray (1972)

**Found confounding variable** 
- Asleep : learning in the evening 
- Awake : learning in the morning 
Thus unclear whether forgetting happened during retention / time of day for learning

### Minami and Dallenbach (1946)

**Procedure:** 
- Cockroaches were trained to avoid a dark box and then had a 24-hour retention interval where they were either active or inactive.
**Outcome:** 
- active cockroaches forgot more than inactive ones, likely due to interference in the active state. 
- slower trace decay in inactive states is due to a slower metabolic rate.
